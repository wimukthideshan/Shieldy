# Shieldy

Developed and implemented a social media-like mobile application that lets users post about current
crises and dangers present. The data gained from the community through crowdsourcing and the
severity of the situations will be sorted using an algorithm and displayed to the user. Once the severity
exceeds a predetermined threshold, the related official government authorities will be notified through
an autogenerated mail.
